# Practice Code Review

This group project had as advantage the benefit of being smaller than previous. And way more self committed about coding.

## Stop Doing

- Not setting a deadline. Even if sadly it is difficult for most of all to fully work daily in the project because of personal issues, without a suggested deadline, sometimes we are not programming ourselves for having a finished result. 

## Continue Doing

- Subdivide the whole group into smaller fractions for a most effective way of communication and solve problems and issues P2P.

- Double check always our code with the useful scripts for ` format ` ` lint ` ` test ` ` document `.  

## Start Doing

- Ask for more help and support from our partners but specially from the coaches who had all the experience and expertise for helping us to solve our technical issues.
